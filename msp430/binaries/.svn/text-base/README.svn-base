This folder contains pre-compiled binaries that can be used with the HiJack
boards. Use the msp-bsl application to flash it onto the board using the
HiJack programmer. The following line uses the TinyOS BSL:

tos-bsl --swap-reset-test --invert-reset --invert-test -c /dev/ttyUSB0 -r -e -I -p hijack_a6.ihex

hijack_a6.ihex: This application communicates at about 100 bytes/s. The
application continuously samples ADC 6 (pin a6) at an 8 bit resolution. The
application sends the values directly to the phone. Received bytes change
the sampling rate of the ADC from about 1 Hz to a maximum of 100 Hz.

hijack_uart0_pass_through.ihex: This applications sends every byte received
on UART0 to the iPhone, and every byte received from the iPhone to UART0.
Note that it does not do any buffering of incomming UART0 bytes. Thus, if
the HiJack is busy sending a byte to the iPhone while there is a new byte
coming in, it will get dropped.
